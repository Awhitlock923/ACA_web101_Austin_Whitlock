        I learned something new in my first class besides how to write in HTML
        and CSS is the importance of putting href and class in the same line of
        code for the same item. I learned that by doing this you save space in
        your code and save time from having to type up another line of code as
        well. It just sparks my interest for coding that much more as well. I
        love learning new ways and tricks to code it’s why coding excites me in
        a way that I can figure out and see many different ways to do one task
        and still come up with the same result allowing me to be as creative as
        I want. From reading up on a doctype I’m starting to understand it’s
        importance. Without the doctype the web browser wouldn’t have anything
        to define what version of language the document is written in. As far as
        I’m able to understand so far is that a web browser is able to determine
        elements is my reading the elements from right to left and matching them
        with a key selector and match the parent element to determine it’s
        matches.

        <h3>BlogPost_2</h3>
        Today in class I got the privileged of learning how to put my project on
        GitHub. Let me tell you this was not an easy task. Aside from all the
        commands and steps that made your mind wonder why so many steps it
        finally became clear as to what I was supposed to do. I can gladly say
        that after hours of troubleshooting and tutoring I finally was able to
        publish my website on GitHub and am able to remember all of the commands
        I need to do it all over again. One of the other things I had to do was
        make a page on my website that would hold my blogs including this one.
        To do this I made a workflow of my steps I would need to do this
        correctly. First I drew out the layout of how I wanted the page to look.
        Second I began the coding until everything was in place. Then third I
        put in the background image and effects that make the page feel more
        alive. Another thing I was told to look up was what an ARIA is. after
        some research I was able to understand that they are commands that are
        made in Javascript because HTML doesn’t know how to identify the scripts
        commands. Therefor Javascript links the script in HTML and is able to
        set commands for the scripts so the web browser knows what to do with
        the information. The last thing I was told to do research on are screen
        readers. This is a feature made for blind or vision impaired people. It
        allows their computer to read the text on the page or translate it into
        braille display. The last thing I want to put in this post is how to
        make a website accessible. The way I made my website accessible was by
        uploading my project into GitHub and allowing GitHub to host as my
        server for my web page. By doing this anyone can access it by using the
        GitHub link that includes my username and the name of the file that I
        uploaded into GitHub.
