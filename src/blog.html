            <h3>BlogPost_1</h3>I learned something new in my first class besides how to write in HTML and CSS is the
            importance of putting href and class in the same line of code for the same item. I learned that by doing
            this you save space in your code and save time from having to type up another line of code as well. It just
            sparks my interest for coding that much more as well. I love learning new ways and tricks to code it’s why
            coding excites me in a way that I can figure out and see many different ways to do one task and still come
            up with the same result allowing me to be as creative as I want. From reading up on a doctype I’m starting
            to understand it’s importance. Without the doctype the web browser wouldn’t have anything to define what
            version of language the document is written in. As far as I’m able to understand so far is that a web
            browser is able to determine elements is my reading the elements from right to left and matching them with
            a key selector and match the parent element to determine it’s matches.

            <h3>BlogPost_2</h3>Today in class I got the privileged of learning how to put my project on GitHub. Let me
            tell you this was not an easy task. Aside from all the commands and steps that made your mind wonder why so
            many steps it finally became clear as to what I was supposed to do. I can gladly say that after hours of
            troubleshooting and tutoring I finally was able to publish my website on GitHub and am able to remember all
            of the commands I need to do it all over again. One of the other things I had to do was make a page on my
            website that would hold my blogs including this one. To do this I made a workflow of my steps I would need
            to do this correctly. First I drew out the layout of how I wanted the page to look. Second I began the
            coding until everything was in place. Then third I put in the background image and effects that make the
            page feel more alive. Another thing I was told to look up was what an ARIA is. after some research I was
            able to understand that they are commands that are made in Javascript because HTML doesn’t know how to
            identify the scripts commands. Therefor Javascript links the script in HTML and is able to set commands for
            the scripts so the web browser knows what to do with the information. The last thing I was told to do
            research on are screen readers. This is a feature made for blind or vision impaired people. It allows their
            computer to read the text on the page or translate it into braille display. The last thing I want to put in
            this post is how to make a website accessible. The way I made my website accessible was by uploading my
            project into GitHub and allowing GitHub to host as my server for my web page. By doing this anyone can
            access it by using the GitHub link that includes my username and the name of the file that I uploaded into
            GitHub.

            <h3>Blogpost_3</h3>Today in class I learned how to link or in other words activate a button on my portfolio page to redirect you to a new
            page I have made for my resume. Before going into class I though it was going to be a very difficult task to learn, but
            I soon learned it wasn’t as long and complicated as it seemed. Just like everything else in code you only have to make
            sure everything is typed in correctly or you’ll get and error not being able to find the page you want to go to.
            Another thing I learned after doing some research was how to hide content on a page and make it only accessible by
            screen readers. You first have to make a command aria-label which will tell the browser if its user is using a screen
            reader then to ignore the regular code and follow specific code the creator has made for the screen reader. Another
            thing that I did some research on was block formatting context. This is when boxes that are created to float and hold
            elements in the boxes and the boxes interact with other elements. This effect is created by any of a number of commands
            in both HTML and CSS. In order to control where the boxes are positioned on the page you need to set a position in the
            code and clear it or else the box could overlap with another element. By controlling where the box is positioned you
            are able to either place the box inside, behind,in front, below, above, or to the side of another element.

            <h3>Blogpost_4</h3>I learned how to resize your web page to fit on smaller devices and look good! For the longest time I was annoyed with
            my page whenever I would try to view it from my phone. So today I have learned how to make the display change depending
            on the resolution of the screen. I did learn however that some of my pages already converted without me having to do
            anything which is kind of nice knowing I don’t have to worry about the pages. One of the things I was told to research
            was the difference between inline and inline-blocks. The difference I was able to find and understand is that
            inline-blocks can set borders for the element such as width and height, and inline can only edit color and style of the
            element. A question I was asked was how would I fix browser specific styling issues. I would do this by changing the
            first thing I notice is wrong like the size or the positioning and start to try different ways to change it till it
            looks the way I want it to.

            <h3>Blogpost_5</h3>Today in class I learned more about CSS grids. I learned how to properly use them so I am able to place the items I
            want where I want them. This feature is really nice when you have to make multiple items on a page sit in a specific
            spot on a page so your page design looks just right. When making a responsive page the main difference is that the page
            automatically adapts to the page size as it changes. A mobile first strategy is already made into a mobile format so
            that the window doesn’t have to be edited for larger devices. between the new Flexbox and Grid specs I tend to like the
            Flexbox more just because it’s easier for me to control my elements on the page, but the Grid is also great to use for
            specific styles I try to achieve. I also learned that you can use @media print to change the display of the widow.
